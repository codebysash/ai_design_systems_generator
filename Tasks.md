## Technical Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers

- **OpenAI API Access**: Need to confirm API key and rate limits
- **Design Decisions**: Need to finalize color palette and typography choices
- **Performance Requirements**: Need to establish baseline performance metrics

### Key Dependencies

- **Design Assets**: Logo and brand assets needed for landing page
- **Content**: Marketing copy and feature descriptions
- **Legal**: Privacy policy and terms of service
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics or alternative tracking setup

### Technical Questions

1. **AI Model Selection**: Should we use GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo for cost optimization?
2. **Component Library**: Should we build custom components or extend existing libraries?
3. **Export Formats**: Which export formats should be prioritized in MVP?
4. **Authentication**: Do we need user accounts in MVP or can we be anonymous?
